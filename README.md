# Orpheus
A deep learning-based approach to understanding and generating musical patterns from MIDI files using the Transformer architecture.




Overview
This project leverages the capabilities of the Transformer model, a state-of-the-art architecture for sequence processing, tailored specifically for MIDI file processing. By converting MIDI files to piano rolls and vice versa, the model aims to predict musical sequences and understand underlying patterns.

Features
Convert MIDI files to piano rolls and back.
Utilize the Transformer model for sequence prediction.
Standardize input data for consistent model training.
Implement training enhancements like learning rate reduction and early stopping.
